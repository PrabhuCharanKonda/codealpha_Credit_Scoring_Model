# codealpha_Credit_Scoring_Model
🔍 Objective The goal is to:

--> Build a credit classification model that predicts loan default risk (good/bad credit)

Use machine learning algorithms such as:

--> Logistic Regression

--> Decision Trees

--> Random Forest

Evaluate performance using industry-standard metrics

📊 Key Features Feature engineering from financial history (e.g. income, debts, payment behavior)

Model evaluation with:

Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC

Flexible pipeline for training, testing, and comparing models
